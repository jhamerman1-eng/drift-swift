# Sprint 1.17.3

## Goal
Establish Swift market-making sidecar scaffolding to enable future trading bots.

## User Stories
- **HTTP stubs for market data and orders**  
  As a developer, I need REST endpoints that serve sample market data and accept orders so I can test integration.
  - *Acceptance Criteria*: GET `/markets` returns a sample order book and POST `/orders` echoes order details.
- **Service documentation**  
  As an operator, I want documentation for the Swift MM sidecar's endpoints to understand how to interact with the service.
  - *Acceptance Criteria*: README describes health, metrics, market data, and order submission endpoints.
- **TypeScript typings**  
  As a contributor, I need proper TypeScript types for Express and WebSocket so the service builds cleanly.
  - *Acceptance Criteria*: `@types/express` and `@types/ws` are included in `package.json` and `npm run build` succeeds.

## Sprint End Change Report
- Introduced HTTP stubs for health, metrics, market data, and order submission in `services/swift-mm`.
- Added an in-memory order book and utilities for handling orders.
- Documented new endpoints and setup instructions in `README_SWIFT_MM.md`.
- Included TypeScript type packages for Express and WebSocket.
